Review feature ideas
    -uwu review (movie name) (1-5)
    checks
        if user already submitted review possible?
        if number is not in range
        if their opinion is just like stupid


Watched List
    -Final list shows review average from uwu review
    Remove button doesnt work
    Since list is theoretically infinite format command so it checks list by month/year movie was added to watced list?
    
    uwu wl =shows months / years where movies were reviewed

    e.x. 
    uwu wl

    [2019]

    October December

    [2020]

    January February March April

    Indiciate what category you would like to look at with:

    uwu wl [year] [month]

    Then user would go like

    uwu wl 2019 december

    and prints watched list in mw2 format

                   Wordl

Play the game in dm's with the bot

Example of how exchange with bot goes
wl = placeholder for prompt for bot 
b = correct letter and correct location (uses discord letter emote E.X. :regional_indicator_c: )
y = correct but wrong location
w = wrong
These are emojis btw the squares
the b y and w are i mean


b00ty:wl guess (example word, lets say adieu)
Woordl: 
ywwyw
adieu

b00ty: wl guess algae
Woordl:
wbwby
algae

b00ty: wl guess pleat
Woordl:
bbbbb







Issues:
Confusing since its just the square and doesnt show the letter
    Maybe put what user typed below the emojis to alleviate? 
    Spacing on this will maybe be a bitch
Need to communicate to user previous attempts + attempts left
Need to communicate to user what buttons have not been used yet
Btw the idea where the bot reacts ot something with the letters or color boxes dont work since they cant repeat the emojis it would jsut be the emoji but with the number 2




Purpose of bot in a server is to compare stats ala how wordle does it

E.X.

b00ty:wl today
Woordl: 
Woordl # <- (what game in the series it is) MM/DD/YY
blank space
(too lazy to type it out but the boxes similar to the share thing I sent to discord from woordl website)

If haven't played todays yet

E.X.

b00ty:wl today
Woordl:
Uh-Oh, Stinky! You haven't played todays word yet retard

If got it wrong

E.X. 

b00ty:wl today
Woordl:
Uh-Oh, Stinky! You didn't get it right today stupid





:green_square: = correct letter and correct location
:yellow_square: = correct letter and wrong location
:white_square: = letter not in word



////////////////////////////
        Player Stats

Personal stats
-How many played
-Win %
-Current Streak
-Best Streak
-Guess Distribution

E.X.

b00ty: wl stats
wordl: # games played 
       #% win rate
       # current streak
       # Best Streak
       Guess Distribution
       1 00000
       2
       3
       4 111111111
       5
       6 

1 = greenbox emoji (indicates most recent game victory played)
0 = white box emoji (indicates previous games)

Formula for determining how many green boxes for each one

# of greenboxes = (round to nearest 10's digit (total # of victories at # guess / overall games played)) / 10

Bot has to record 1 2 3 4 5 6 numbers 
Maybe if you also record 7+ you can just add them to get games played instead of recording games played as a seperate number?
Idk sounds stupid just spitting it out there

issue is how do you represent keyboard 
its a core part of wordle website
